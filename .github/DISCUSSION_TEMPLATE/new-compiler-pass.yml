      description: |
        a. What circuit types will this improve? (e.g., dynamic circuits, error correction)  
        b. Which [UCC metrics](https://ucc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarking.html) will it impact? (gate counts, errors, etc.)
      placeholder: |
        Example response:
        "This should reduce 2-qubit gates by ~30% for circuits with >50 CX gates..."
